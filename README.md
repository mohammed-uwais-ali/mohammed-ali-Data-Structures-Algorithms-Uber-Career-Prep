Welcome to the "Algorithms and Data Structures" GitHub repository! This repository contains a collection of code implementations for various algorithms and data structures in Java. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn more about algorithms and data structures or an experienced developer brushing up on your knowledge, the following 


## Introduction

In this repository, we provide code examples for essential algorithms and data structures commonly used in computer science and software development. Understanding algorithms and data structures is crucial for writing efficient and optimized code, solving complex problems, and acing technical interviews.

The code implementations are written in multiple programming languages, making it accessible to a broader audience. Each algorithm and data structure is accompanied by detailed explanations and comments to help you understand the underlying concepts and logic behind the code.

## Algorithms

This section contains various algorithm implementations, including sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, graph algorithms, and more. Some of the algorithms covered in this repository include:

- String Permutation
- Link List reversal
- Binary Search
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Traversals of Data Structures
- Two Pointer Approach 
- Turtle and Hare Algorithm 


The algorithms are organized by categories, making it easier to find and explore the ones you are interested in.

## Data Structures

In the Data Structures section, you will find implementations of fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, and more. Understanding these data structures is essential for building efficient and scalable applications.

Some of the data structures available in this repository are:

- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Strings 
- Hash Maps
- Graphs
- Trees
- and more to come


## Unit Tests

Alongside this, you can first hand see how valuable it is to write unit tests to ensure code accuracy and code quality

Happy coding! ðŸš€
